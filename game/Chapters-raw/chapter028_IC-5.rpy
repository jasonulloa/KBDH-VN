    "Though she had previously already considered the feasibility of just altering whatever data she could find into different outfits, Yuki was able to recognize that the request wasn't {i}just{/i} to get her to change her clothes. She had access to several references that suggested shopping as a bonding experience and relatively standard social activity."
    "Then again, theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge weren't always identical."
    "So she walked at the side of her time traveling friend, strolling through the crowds as they walked a path very similar to the one she had walked with her other brigade members the night before. Mikuru touched a fingertip to her lips and looked around thoughtfully, her eyes lingering on several of the smaller boutiques before she settled on one and pointed it out, asking, \"Should we look in there to see if there's anything you like?\""
    "There wasn't much distinctive about the shop, other than the fact that it appeared to cater exclusively to females. Two of the stores that Mikuru hadn't decided to point out also qualified in that regard, which left the potential of this store's superiority to some factor that Yuki was positive she observed. She simply couldn't quantify it. \"In this instance,\" she answered, turning to look at Mikuru, wondering if the time traveler would be able to sense her regret, \"I must defer to your judgment.\""
    "Mikuru, while not as sharp as the boy they were both interested in, seemed to understand at least some of her trouble. \"Well, this place has a good variety of types of clothes, at least. We can find out what you're comfortable wearing! Your outfits last summer vacation were very cute, I think! Did you like those?\""
    "It was different from what she was used to, in any case. She followed Mikuru into the boutique and looked at the variety of clothing on display. All manner of shirts, blouses, shorts, skirts.... She could name all of them, matching styles and colors to her reference pool. She could even identify which combinations would not adhere to social expectations, within a small degree of error."
    "But had she {i}liked{/i} them? She couldn't say she actually cared for them either way, except for the fact that they were slightly simpler to put on than her school uniform. In that regard, she calculated that she preferred clothing that was easy to wear. Was that enough for Mikuru to work with?"
    "\"Yes,\" she answered, while the time traveler waved off an attendant and stopped at a display of shorts, not far from a racks of blouses."
    "\"Hum.... You know your sizes, right?\""
    "\"Yes.\""
    "Mikuru tapped her chin thoughtfully, then turned away from the clothing and studied Yuki for a moment. \"Yuki-chan ... what kinds of clothing have you worn before?\""
    "\"School uniform, casual clothing for summer vacation, traditional attire for the obon festival, swim-wear when appropriate, fortune teller costume, and cold-weather wear for winter,\" she replied. \"Additionally, a coat and scarf over the school uniform.\""
    "Mikuru pursed her lips thoughtfully. \"So, I've pretty much seen all of the clothes you've ever worn,\" she noted."
    "Yuki nodded at her."
    "\"So, you've never tried wearing a sundress, for example?\""
    "She shook her head."
    "Mikuru smiled, then found an example of the garment in question. \"Let's see what your colors are,\" she mused, pulling a handful of hangers from the display, then holding them up against Yuki, one at a time. After she'd put all but three back, she handed them back to Yuki. \"I'm not sure, really,\" she said, shaking her head and smiling. \"So, try these on, and we'll see how you look, okay?\""
    "\"Yes,\" she agreed, her eyes settling on the changing booth at the far end of the store. Mikuru waved her into the booth, and then closed the curtain so she could change. The full length mirror in the booth with her let her try to judge her appearance herself, but she had already modeled how the dress would fit internally."
    "No significant deviance from her internal model. She couldn't see how it changed her much, except that the lines of her clothes were now much simpler than her school uniform, and the color was a pale, buttery yellow. She opened the curtain, unsurprised that Mikuru was waiting outside for her, already holding more articles of clothing."
    "The time traveler's reaction suggested that the dress did not suit her."
    "Still, that helped her establish a baseline. Some values of the current garment were obviously a poor combination. But then, she didn't have to try and determine this herself: \"This is not adequate?\""
    "\"W...well, I think that color doesn't suit you, but the style does,\" Mikuru answered, looking apologetic. \"Um.... That was a bad call on my part. So ... well, try on the green one?\""
    "Yuki nodded and closed the curtain, changing outfits once more. Would she end up trying on everything in the store?"
    "She calculated how long that would take, determining that it wasn't going to be feasible without missing school, and most likely the movie that the clothes were being acquired in preparation for. Surely the time traveler had some algorithm or methodology that she hadn't yet determined herself.... Some concept that Yuki had not yet managed to emulate herself."
    "After straightening out the green sundress she opened the curtain again. Mikuru's reactions felt — oddly — significantly more informative than the mirror did. \"Yes,\" the time traveler said, beaming a bright, pleased smile at Yuki, before snapping a picture with her cell phone. \"This cool mint tone works very well with you!\""
    "It was pale, but brought to mind the color of the male school uniforms. One positive factor of what worked for her, identified."
    "Mikuru indicated the other clothes she had hanging over one arm, adding, \"I'll put that yellow sundress away for you ... did you want to try the blue one, too? I think it might suits you fairly well.\""
    "\"No need,\" Yuki answered, blinking. \"This color is superior.\" After all, the other girl had made that observation herself."
    "\"A...ah, okay,\" Mikuru agreed, nodding. \"But, Yuki-chan.... Since you're wearing that now, you must tell me at least if you think it's comfortable. Is that something you think you could enjoy wearing?\""
    "Well, a sundress was quite easy to put on, so it was at least an efficient garment. Mikuru had approved of the color, and seemed certain that the combination was aesthetically appealing. She still was uncertain, unable to effectively determine if she {i}liked{/i} it. It wasn't something she could classify as easily as an interesting book, or one of her favorite people. Did 'liking' have to extend to things as simple as objects?"
    "People and stories were unique data structures. Clothing wasn't much different from flakes of snow.... At a glance, they seemed unique, but in reality, there were merely a plethora of distinct variations. To find uniqueness again, one had to look at a level that human perception could not typically observe unaided anyway."
    "Unable to answer the question, and aware of Mikuru's growing apprehension as she watched, Yuki finally tried something she had considered, but not attempted before, outside of occasional attempts at humor. 'Off color' or poorly timed attempts at humor blended in with her assigned personality, but this.... Her primary protection target frequently compared unlike things, seeming to discard non-analogous aspects of the unlike things, and reaching a reasonable and logical conclusion anyway."
    "If she looked at clothing not as merely objects, but as a form of expression (her references suggested that this was a frequently accepted view), then it was a way to frame her{i}self{/i}. In other words, Mikuru was trying to teach her to express herself in a different way. Words were difficult enough ... how could she master expressing herself through actions? It was difficult enough to choose a phone — just like identifying an item on a restaurant menu as desirable. How could she apply that to clothing?"
    "She turned her attention to the frilly shoulder straps of the dress that she was currently wearing. \"I do not ... like this,\" she said, tugging at the ruffle. \"It is unnecessary.\""
    "Mikuru seemed oddly pleased at that. \"Good!\" she said, nodding. \"The whole thing, or just the ruffle?\""
    "While it was extraneous, as well, the bow across the dress's chest didn't bother her nearly as much. \"Just the ruffle,\" she echoed."
    "The time traveler considered this for a moment, then picked one of the garments out of the bundle in her arms. \"This is a jumper,\" she noted. \"Maybe you'll like it better? It seems that simple clothes are the ones you like best?\""
    "Yuki nodded, thinking that sounded accurate."
    "Mikuru nodded, her smile a bit faded as she considered. \"Okay, I know a few ways we can coordinate different outfits — let's get to it, then, shall we?\""
    "Accepting the jumper, Yuki calculated how long it would take to try on various other articles, given the amount of time spent already. Given what she'd managed to exclude, the new projection was still lengthy. The odds of reaching home before it was time to eat seemed to be slim, at best."
    "Some thirty three articles of clothing and almost as many pictures later, the pair had amassed a small heap of clothing that were both approved by Mikuru and accepted as 'likeable' by Yuki. As per Mikuru's suggestion, Yuki's taste seemed to veer as far from complexity as possible. She wondered if that qualified as a real opinion, or just a judgment that she didn't like to spend more time dressing than required."
    "The hour and half spent so far went against what she would have chosen to do with her own time. But, strangely, it didn't bother her. Was it because it was time with Mikuru? Her friend? Was it because Mikuru looked happy, helping her pick clothing out?"
    "She had decided that it must be a bit of both when Mikuru declared, \"I think we're done!\""
    "Yuki nodded and collected the clothes they had decided on, carrying them to the counter. The clerk at the register seemed quite pleased at the variety, and engaged Mikuru in small talk about upcoming fashion trends while ringing up the total. After Yuki paid and her new outfits were bagged, Mikuru waved to the clerk and the pair left the store together."
    "\"And now,\" Mikuru said, scanning up and down the street, \"the next store!\""
    "Blinking, Yuki turned a questioning gaze to the time traveler. \"These are not adequate?\" she asked, wondering if deferring to Mikuru's judgment in these matters may not have been the best idea."
    "\"That's only the basics!\" Mikuru said, shaking her head. \"Yuki-chan, you're going to need accessories, too. What if you're wearing an outfit that has no pockets? You'll need a purse!\""
    "She considered, and double checked her references, but Mikuru was correct; she did not have a purse. She nodded at the time traveler, trusting her judgment."
    "\"Hum, come to think of it ... I suppose the swimsuit you had last year still fits you?\""
    "Yuki had not grown enough for that to change, so she nodded."
    "Mikuru smiled at her. \"Well, if you're happy with that, then it's no problem.\""
    "Was she 'happy' with that? Her existing swim-wear was functional, which was her primary concern. It was even one of the colors that Mikuru had judged were good for her."
    "She wasn't exactly distracted, as her focus wasn't narrow enough in normal circumstances for that to happen. Something in the other being's proximity field masked her presence more than announced it, and as a result, Yuki was not acutely {i}aware{/i} of the presence of the other — Suou Kuyou — until she was in Mikuru's visual range."
    "Yuki would not have missed the presence of Sasaki or Kyouko, however, and deduced that through some means Suou Kuyou had actively concealed them from her awareness until the point where visual contact was established. In relative conformity to the situation around them — shoppers wandering between stores — Sasaki was evidently discussing something with Kyouko about that girl's associates."
    "She abandoned thinking about clothing for the moment, focusing her attention on the other three. Mikuru allowed an alarmed squeak to escape when her eyes met Kyouko's, then searched the crowd anxiously, scanning for some other threat."
    "Sasaki exhibited several mostly concealed stress cues; her eyes continually flicked to the girl at her side, and she shifted her shoulders an almost imperceptible distance. Her fingers wouldn't stay still, and she kept a purse on her shoulder, small though it was, between herself and Kyouko."
    "Kyouko demonstrated tension, but not anxiety. More subtle cues hinted at barely concealed anger; her slightly stiff movements, her overemphasized steps, and a shift in stance towards aggression."
    "She absorbed that in an instant. But from Kuyou, Yuki could determine absolutely nothing beyond the fact that she was staring fixedly at her. While Yuki was aware of the overlapping layers of reality — inaccessible and usually imperceptible to most humans. Kuyou was, as well, but neither entity {i}acted{/i} at that level. Both merely observed."
    "What was Kuyou's plan, though? Was she an enemy, or an ally? Given that she {i}could{/i} be an enemy to the entity, there was a {i}potential{/i} that she could be an ally.... Provided she didn't intend harm to any of Yuki's friends. While she could easily put her faith in one boy, going so far as to tell him that she was willing to bet on him, she couldn't extend any of that trust to an unknown entity if it meant risking him."
    "Even Hanyuu had to demonstrate something opposite ill will before Yuki could regard a being as potentially dangerous as herself or Kuyou an ally."
    "As far as Yuki could determine from context, Sasaki had been expressing her displeasure at the methods of Kyouko's group. Kyouko cut her off with an insincere smile and a quick, \"Oh, Sasaki-san, if it isn't Kyon-san's friends!\""
    "\"W...what do you want?\" Mikuru asked, struggling to keep the apprehension from her voice."
    "\"I'm not here to threaten you,\" Kyouko said, crossing her arms over her chest and looking away. \"Why can't you get over that?\""
    "Yuki had never observed an expression on Mikuru's face nearing anger, but she was aware of the small cues in her friend suggesting that she was near it. Only a greater level of fear kept her from expressing it. Sasaki gave her friend a sharp, but very brief look. Yuki doubted Mikuru had noticed it."
    "\"A...aside from that, then, if we don't have any business, then, um ... well, have a nice day and enjoy your shopping, I guess,\" the time traveler said unsteadily, giving a very weak smile to the other three."
    "Kyouko opened her mouth to protest, and Sasaki coughed before she could speak. \"Well, we don't intend to bother you, either. This encounter was just coincidence,\" she said. \"Um, about a month ago, Asahina-san, I saw Kyon with your sister ... I've been trying to get a hold of him ever since, but it seems he's not returning my calls.... Is he upset with me, do you know?\""
    "Mikuru was baffled, but didn't betray it at a level either of the other girls seemed able to notice. \"Oh.... W...well, let's see.... I'm terribly sorry, but Kyon-kun hasn't mentioned you, really.\" She thought for a moment, then asked, \"W...was he with, ah, my twin sister?\""
    "\"No, no,\" Sasaki replied with a shake of her head, laughing. \"She was older ... dressed like a teacher. Fujiwara-kun called her by your name by mistake. Though, it seems they know one-another, as well!\""
    "Whatever was stressing Sasaki, Yuki noted that the effect of it was wearing off. She was less bothered now than when the encounter had just begun. Kyouko, on the other hand, was becoming more irate. What internal stresses did their group suffer from?"
    "She felt certain she knew one person who might be able to determine that...."
    "Mikuru shook her head. \"I have no idea what that's about,\" she said honestly. \"I haven't, um, spoken with any family lately.\""
    "\"You live alone?\" Kyouko asked."
    "Mikuru pressed her lips together tightly, and Sasaki gave a curious look to her companion."
    "\"Well, you should take care,\" Mikuru said decisively, ignoring the question and taking Yuki's closer elbow in her hand. \"Goodbye.\""
    "Though she looked forward, the majority of Yuki's senses were on the others. She allowed Mikuru to lead her away, modeling combat with Kuyou and preparing contingencies to protect Mikuru, should it be required. There was still enough focus remaining for her to observe that Sasaki had once again become upset with Kyouko."
    "And through it all, Kuyou did absolutely nothing but watch her."
    "A block and a half away, heading back towards Yuki's apartment, Mikuru released Yuki's arm and hugged herself, shivering, looking back over her shoulder anxiously. Not that the others were in sight. They had gone into one of the storefronts, and with a suddenness that Yuki determined must be Kuyou's data manipulation (or some other effect that appeared very {i}like{/i} data manipulation), they had abruptly vanished from her awareness."
    "\"S...scary,\" Mikuru whimpered. \"O...oh.... I didn't like any of that!\""
    "\"Unpleasant,\" Yuki agreed."
    "\"Ooh....\" Mikuru shivered again."
    "Reprioritizing her focus, Yuki turned to look at her friend. Kyouko's inference that Mikuru lived alone, and the request for verification obviously had come across as a threat. While she hadn't been there for it, she was aware of the incident where Kyouko and her group had tried to kidnap Mikuru. \"You are scared,\" she noted."
    "\"Y...yes,\" Mikuru agreed, sighing. \"I'm a coward.... Ooh.... I don't even want to go home, now! W...what if....\" She shivered, shaking her head. \"N...never mind that, though. Um. W...we should finish shopping for you, anyway.\""
    "Yuki considered the situation. It was very unlikely that Kyouko would be able to succeed if she were to attempt kidnapping Mikuru again. Though the time traveler seemed oblivious, Yuki herself was acutely aware of the fact that they were already being trailed by five people currently."
    "Three of them were wearing the same pin as Kyon — the symbol of the Tsuruya clan. The female esper would not get far with Mikuru before she was stopped, and Sasaki did not exhibit that much hostility."
    "Suou Kuyou might have been a different matter.... But Yuki was confident that she could at least delay the other entity long enough for Mikuru to be helped."
    "None of those facts were guaranteed to actively reassure the other girl, however. \"There is an empty room in my apartment,\" she said quietly. \"You are ... welcome if you wish.\""
    "Mikuru blinked at her in surprise, her mouth dropping open a slight distance. \"W...well, tonight, at least, would be nice,\" the time traveler agreed. \"Um.... Y...you're a very thoughtful friend, Yuki-chan. Thank you. Ah! I know, I'll cook dinner for you tonight, is that alright?\""
    "\"It is fine,\" she agreed."
    "Smile restored, Mikuru nodded at Yuki and led the way into the shopping district once more. \"J...just two more stops, then. We'll get you a purse or two, then visit the market?\""
    "Yuki nodded, wondering if it would be appropriate to offer the other girl a hug once they were in a private location. She would have to ask once they got to her apartment."
    "* * *"
    "Tsuruya was so absorbed in reading the reports she'd gotten back from her father's lab that she entirely failed to notice what was going on until after her head maid — Shinobu — had started to help her dress. Even then, she was only roused from her distraction when she realized that Shinobu was pulling on a third layer of elaborate robes. \"Wah?\" she managed, surprised, looking down at herself. \"A junihitoe?\""
    "\"That's right,\" Shinobu agreed. \"Your father was very insistent.\""
    "She didn't even know her father had commissioned such a thing! When she looked around her room in dismay, she could tell by the boxes on the floor that she had at least another ten kilos of costume to look forward to wearing. \"Too much!\" she said, giggling anyway, and still cooperating with her maid. \"It'll takes an hour to get all these layers on, at least!\""
    "\"Yes,\" the maid agreed, apologetically. \"I strongly advise against drinking much of anything ... the washroom will be particularly difficult to use.\""
    "Tsuruya blinked at that, having not even considered it. \"Wah ... and now I'm thirsties,\" she chuckled, shaking her head. \"Why a junihitoe?\""
    "\"Your father didn't say,\" Shinobu acknowledged. \"However, as this complex outfit was historically reserved for royalty, or at least nobles, might it be his way of saying that you're his princess?\""
    "\"But, people don't even wear these,\" Tsuruya mused, as they started pulling on yet another layer. \"Um, I recognize this color scheme from lessons.... 'Nadeshiko'.\" The robes were layered from innermost white, to outermost plum, with the layers smoothly shifting the spectrum across them. Once she was fully dressed, the shades would all be visible along the hems of her sleeves, and across her chest."
    "The meaning to her was obvious; a yamato nadeshiko was a traditional wildflower. In this instance, the color scheme meant to suggest that she was a traditional flower of Japanese womanhood. Why had her father thought this was what she should wear?"
    "\"Empress Michiko wore one during the Emperor's coronation,\" Shinobu commented, answering the unvoiced question."
    "\"Two decades ago,\" Tsuruya allowed, rolling her eyes. \"Hum.... Well, it's a nuisances, but that's okay! Pictures for Haru-nyan!\""
    "\"I doubt that your father would let this pass without at least a few photographs,\" the maid agreed."
    "After enduring a nearly hour-long dressing process, then additional minutes of hair styling and a very faint layer of makeup, she was finally done. Shinobu then excused herself to change, returning surprisingly quickly in a simpler (but still complex) kimono, dressed as an attendant."
    "Entirely unsurprisingly to her, once her father's limousine pulled up to the estate, he was dressed in an immaculate kimono of his own. The outermost layer matched her robes, except for being slightly more subdued in color. Both of their costumes had a repeating pattern of the family crest."
    "He grinned widely at her, his fang gleaming, eyes shining.... What was he getting so emotional about? Why all the production?"
    "It was fun, if a bit silly.... But her father had {i}always{/i} had a habit of going overboard. After spending a few minutes getting her clothing entirely in the vehicle, only Shinobu's keen eye and quick hands preventing the robe's trailing end from dragging across the ground, she was seated next to him. Shinobu quietly sat opposite the pair, politely looking away once Kasai closed the door."
    "Tsuruya tried to elbow her father in the ribs once the vehicle started moving, but the thick layers of cloth prevented her from doing much more than fumbling at him. He chuckled at her, asking, \"You likes it?\""
    "\"Decadent,\" she giggled. \"I hopes Kyon-kun isn't intimidated by it!\""
    "He snorted, shaking his head. \"Not once you tells him what we learned!\" the man said, grinning. \"Now, did you bring that paperwork from the labs?\""
    "\"No pockets!\""
    "\"I have the papers, Tsuruya-sama,\" Shinobu said quietly. \"As well as Kyon- dono's heirloom tsuba.\""
    "\"Excellent!\" her father said, laughing. \"Then tonight shall be a night to remember!\""
    "Tsuruya nodded happily. Hopefully, Kyon would think her outfit was cute. Or funny. As long as it made him smile, it would be worth it — she was certain Haruhi would adore the pictures, at any rate."
    "The rest of the ride was quiet, since they were so close to the restaurant that her father had chosen. When they got there, Kasai opening the doors, Shinobu climbed out first to help with the robe's train. Looking around, Tsuruya recognized that they were at Nishinomiya's most exclusive restaurant. The classic styled building sat in the middle of dozens of acres of elaborate gardens, meant to evoke images of an ancient palace."
    "Strangely, except for some of her father's men surrounding the area, she didn't see the signs of anyone else there.... The somewhat uncomfortable walk to the building proper took nearly ten minutes, thanks to the slow hobble that her garment enforced, and then what Tsuruya guessed was the entire serving staff of the restaurant was waiting immediately inside."
    "Her father moved ahead of her to speak with the head waiter, and Tsuruya pulled her fan from her sash, opening it and waving it, incidentally hiding the lower half of her face from the room as she asked Shinobu, \"Did father buy this place...?\""
    "Shinobu gave an incredibly minute nod in response, and Tsuruya was hard- pressed to avoid breaking into laughter. That really felt like his solution to everything, some days. Still, in this setting, she needed to maintain some sense of decorum. After she schooled her expression, just before her father turned back and beckoned her to follow him, she stowed her fan where it belonged. Not long after that, they were in the restaurant's best private room."
    "The entire exterior wall was made of sliding panels, left open for the cool spring air, and revealing a host of floating candles drifting across the garden's main pond. A single low table sat in the middle of the vast room, while a small crew of (also) period-dressed serving staff hovered at the outer perimeter — Shinobu moving to stand next to them and blending in seamlessly."
    "After sinking to sit with her back to the open wall, Tsuruya wondered if the setting might just be a bit {i}too{/i} much for Kyon's family. Certainly, the clothing was over the top — by leaps and bounds."
    "Her father sat nearby, to her left, and nodded with approval. \"They should be here soon,\" he remarked, though Tsuruya didn't see a watch on him. He tended to have a very good sense of time, though, so she nodded her agreement."
    "After a few quiet minutes, the silence only punctuated by the regular sound of a shishi-odoshi in the garden, Tsuruya had to restrain the urge to fidget. Some seventeen iterations of the sound of a bamboo tube falling to resound off a stone passed, giving her time to wonder at the odds of the antiquated device serving its intended function, instead of just being a symbol of the place's culture. Eventually, however, a member of the staff entered the room and was immediately intercepted by Shinobu. After a hushed exchange the messenger retreated, and Shinobu approached the table, kneeling near Tsuruya's father to murmur, \"Your guests arrive, Tsuruya-sama.\""
    "\"Excellent,\" he said, nodding once more."
    "Shinobu moved to the room's entrance, and the doors opened to admit Kyon's family. Tsuruya saw that her initial guess was correct.... While Kyon seemed to have adapted to the situation, even he looked awed at the surroundings. And then his eyes fell upon her, and most of his pretenses at self control were washed away."
    "She was of two minds about that. It {i}was{/i} quite rewarding to see the boy she liked awestruck over her, so that was nice. On the other hand, the excessive formality of the occasion were probably off-putting, and she wasn't really sure she appreciated that part so much."
    "And then he {i}did{/i} smile, and it was worth it. That sense of security she got when he gave her an almost identical smile after saving her from enemy yakuza, or reassurance that he didn't regret being involved with her.... It was {i}that{/i} smile, so everything was okay after all."
    "His parents were already operating at a level that Tsuruya would label shell- shocked, at best, and she felt a bit guilty for his mother, especially. The woman looked painfully self aware in her much simpler dark blue dress. Kyon's father was glassy-eyed, unsure which aspect of the decor or the surroundings to try not to gawk at."
    "Shinobu moved unobtrusively to Kyon's side and murmured something to him, too low to carry to the table, and snapped him out of his daze. The trio approached the table, Kyon sitting opposite Tsuruya at Shinobu's direction, and his parents opposite her father. Personally, Tsuruya would have been happier if the setting were a bit more relaxed, and Kyon were sitting right next to her."
    "Come to think of it.... The moon was nearly full, and the angle would be just right for her to be framed in the reflection from his vantage point, too. She'd absolutely need to try arranging some time with Kyon in a less severe setting. Hopefully the movie they were planning on seeing next week would work."
    "\"Welcome!\" her father boomed, grinning at Kyon's parents. \"Welcome!\""
    "\"W...we're quite grateful to be invited to such an occasion,\" Yuuto managed, still a bit awed by the surroundings."
    "The first wave of drinks was brought out, the staff serving tea and water silently to everyone at the table before retreating. \"So, as much as I adores elaborate settings, I don't care abouts formalities most of the time — especially where family is concerned,\" her father added, nodding at Kyon's parents. \"Relax! This is an auspicious occasions, isn't it?\""
    "Kyon's mother nodded in response, shakily sipping at her tea. Tsuruya allowed herself only the tiniest sip of her own drink, keeping Shinobu's earlier warning in mind. \"E...even so,\" Kyon's father said, \"it would be wrong to be anything other than grateful for such an opportunity.\""
    "\"Commendable humility!\" Tsuruya's father boomed. \"But, no worries! Yuuto-kun, how has works been treating you?\""
    "\"Ah, quite well,\" Yuuto acknowledged, seeming to become slightly more grounded at the reminder of his job. \"Um, actually, allow me to express my gratitude for promoting Yoshida-sensei to his new position.\""
    "\"He's getting on in his years, and was making mistakes,\" Tsuruya's father answered with a shrug. \"Howevers ... more than four decades of experience instills a man with great knowledge. Yoshida's wisdoms should not be wasted! How are you getting along with your new section heads?\""
    "\"Suzumiya-san?\" Yuuto asked."
    "Tsuruya couldn't help but cover her mouth before she giggled at that, and Kyon managed to break free from whatever force had stunned him long enough to exchange a more amused smile with her, as well."
    "\"Yes, he's the one,\" Tsuruya's father agreed. \"Seems a bit stiff and eager to complains, but a solid worker.\""
    "\"Ah ... that matches my views on him,\" Kyon's father agreed, ducking his head slightly and nodding sheepishly. \"I didn't work with him directly at Nishinomiya Heavy, naturally. Still, he seems a good person; he talks about his daughter at work a lot, so I know he's a family man, at least.\""
    "\"Family is one of the most important things ever,\" Tsuruya's father said, nodding, then turning his gaze to her. \"Speaking of this.... Haru-chan?\""
    "\"Ah,\" Tsuruya allowed, grinning. \"Yesterday, Kyon-kun asked me to research somethings for him,\" she said. Recognizing her cue, Shinobu set a small bundle with the tsuba of Kyon's family and the paperwork they had gotten from the lab at her side. Tsuruya picked up the paperwork, first, presenting it towards Kyon's parents. \"The maker's mark that Kyon-kun copied was the mark of Sukemune, student of Sukehiro, of the Settsu regions.\""
    "Kyon's father's face lit up, while his mother merely looked puzzled — but distracted from looking embarrassed, so that was something."
    "\"Settsu is an archaic name, but is this very region,\" her father supplied helpfully."
    "Tsuruya nodded. \"Sukemune crafted weapons for many samurai — but the tang of this weapons also had a personal dedication,\" she continued. \"So the lineage of this blade is known; the inscription reads, 'be as worthy of the Taira descendant as the original'.\""
    "\"T...Taira!?\" Kyon's father sputtered, eyes widening. \"S...surely that's.... I mean.... R...really?\""
    "Placing the tsuba on the table, Tsuruya nodded again. It had been cleaned — but not polished. The tarnish was a proof of age and heritage, after all! \"This tsuba has another name on it, inscribed around the edge.\" She slid it to Kyon's father, who picked it up with reverence, eyes glowing as he studied the characters that were previously concealed beneath grime and grit. \"Also, the metals was tested and carbon-dated — accurate to within thirty years — and was worked about one thousand years ago, so around one thousand A.D. Can you read the names on the tsuba?\""
    "\"Usui Sadamitsu,\" Kyon's mother said, her eyes evidently sharper than her husband's. \"But ... I thought that was just a fairy tale?\""
    "\"The heroic legends of Raiko may only be a legend,\" Tsuruya's father acknowledged. \"However, the families were real. Minamoto no Yorimitsu himself — also known as Minamoto no Raiko — was an ally of the Fujiwara clan while they were one of the four great families in powers at that time. Speaking of those great families, Taira was one of them!"
    "\"It has for a very long time been a point of pride that the Tsuruya clans is descended from the Minamoto line. My daughter will be the one hundred and eighth head of that same clans. While the title may change, the roles is the same.\" Technically, she was already an oyabun in her own right, but she nodded her acknowledgement anyway."
    "\"The sword was in my grandfather's things,\" Kyon's father explained, sounding almost apologetic. \"I wish I'd asked him more about it, now, but....\" He shrugged, still looking somewhat awestruck."
    "\"E...even so,\" Kyon's mother said, dubiously impressed, \"where did this sword come from? It's not related to {i}our{/i} family — Taira isn't our family name.\""
    "\"Wasn't Usui Sadamitsu's real name, er ... wasn't she actually named 'Taira no Tadamichi'?\" Kyon asked hesitantly, his voice hushed in the great room."
    "\"{i}Exactly{/i}!\" Tsuruya's father boomed, pounding one fist on the table in delight. \"So, this is {i}fate{/i}, not mere happenstance!\""
    "\"It is quite amazing,\" Kyon's mother marveled, looking at the papers and the tsuba in astonishment. \"B...but, this doesn't really constitute {i}proof{/i} of anything, does it? Isn't it still possible that Yuuto's grandfather or one of his ancestors found or bought the sword this came from?\""
    "\"I believe it is fate,\" her father said resolutely. \"And that is why now, more than ever, I believe our children should be engaged.\""
    "In a moment of eerie synchronization, Tsuruya realized that she and Kyon were precisely as unprepared for that announcement, both of them turning curious, alarmed gazes at one another. Not that she {i}minded{/i} in the {i}least{/i}.... But expecting it was an entirely different matter! Obviously, he'd had no warning, either."
    "Well ... that was the kind of thing that her father would pull, she admitted to herself. And she wanted to laugh again — how silly! This was supposed to be an omiai? Was {i}that{/i} what all of the production and extravagant dressing up was for? If so, that explained why her father was so excited about Kyon's heritage."
    "But then, as she thought about it.... Haruhi would probably {i}not{/i} be delighted."
    "\"I...I'm not entirely certain I'm swayed by the tsuba,\" Kyon's mother managed."
    "Tsuruya felt a small pang at the relief that Kyon showed at that remark. Then again, she reminded herself, he was probably more concerned with Haruhi becoming furious over this development. If it weren't so hilarious at the moment, she would be more concerned about it herself!"
    "\"Still,\" her father pressed. \"While it's meaningful to me, I understands if you wish to set that legacy aside for the moment. I stand by my suggestions.\""
    "\"And it seems reasonable to me, on those grounds,\" Kyon's mother agreed, nodding. \"I just don't want it to turn out that Kyon's {i}not{/i} descended from this lineage, and then the whole deal being thrown out.\""
    "\"No worries!\" Tsuruya's father insisted. \"His own merits tells me he's good enough for my daughter!\""
    "\"Y...you mean...\" Kyon managed, staring at his mother with wide eyes."
    "Kyon's mother nodded at him, beaming a bright smile. \"It's all taken care of, Kyon!\" she said. \"Tsuruya Haruka-chan is a positive influence on you! Isn't it fortunate that your parents are working so hard to ensure you're taken care of?\""
    "\"Y...yeah,\" Kyon forced out in the manner of one who has been told he has only hours to live. \"S...so ... fortunate.\""
    "Tsuruya's father leaned forward and pounded Kyon's back companionably. \"That's our boy!\" he cheered. \"Ah, Yuuto — join me in a toasts to our children! Think of it! Two families, separated for a thousand years, and once again united!\""
    "Tsuruya ducked her head slightly, feeling a blush coming on as she pressed one hand against her face. Maybe she had been too quick to dismiss her anime as unrealistic? Or, maybe her father had thought that making this event a complete surprise was a good idea {i}based{/i} on her anime? Oh ... this was going to be awkward to explain to Haruhi."
    "* * *"
    "After spending the better part of two hours listening to his parents (and Tsuruya's father) discuss the terms of his engagement to Tsuruya, and mechanically eating a meal that was {i}probably{/i} exquisite, the occasion finally ended. His father had tried to keep up with Tsuruya's father, but ended up too drunk to drive, and his mother didn't have a license. Tsuruya's maid arranged for another of the family's limousines to give the three a ride home."
    "Other than being the target of a plot that Kyon had thought only happened in manga and anime, Kyon had no idea where to begin genuinely considering the implications. His sister naturally demanded details, so he told her that it was very formal, and there was nothing to do. She pouted, but seemed to accept that answer."
    "After spending the entire night without sleep, broken only by the nightly training, he found himself uneagerly leaving home to walk to school."
    "At least, he {i}did{/i} have a better idea of why his mother thought so highly of Tsuruya.... Because she didn't trust him to make his own decisions, and thought his future would be more secure with her."
    "The girl in question was waiting for him in a limousine, and he belatedly remembered that she traditionally paid him on Fridays. It wasn't like he could be mad at Tsuruya for setting the whole thing up — she looked just as surprised as he was by the announcement. After climbing into the limousine to sit next to her, she sighed and gave him an apologetic smile."
    "\"Um,\" she said suddenly, shaking her head. \"This is this week's pay for you....\""
    "\"I am grateful to receive this,\" he acknowledged, with the usual formula, bowing his head as he tucked it into his greatcoat's inner pocket. \"S...so, thank you, Tsuruya-kun.\""
    "Technically, aside from being his superior in her organization, and his subordinate in Haruhi's, now Tsuruya was ... well ... his fiancee as well. Should he start calling her by her first name? But then, that wouldn't be appropriate in business matters...."
    "And all of that was ignoring the fact that Haruhi was most likely going to explode, leveling most of Japan. He looked outside moodily. Why did the last day of his life have to be so bright and cheery? It should at least have the decency to be overcast and rainy."
    "\"I'll explains what happened to Haru-nyan,\" she said, breaking the silence."
    "He started, turning to look at her, where she was gazing out the opposite window. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. As her sometimes bodyguard, advisor, and now fiance, he was pretty sure he would completely fail all roles if he just let her end her life in such a way. \"Explain what?\""
    "\"Ah....\" She smiled at him, blushing cutely. \"About my father's.... Ah, well, about us!\""
    "\"Maybe you should let me do that,\" he suggested. That should give Tsuruya enough time to run, possibly to some sort of shelter...."
    "She shook her head, giggling. \"I...it will be okay. Um.... I don't really minds, but I think that's not what you want. So.... I can tell Haru-nyan that we're engaged ... but being engaged doesn't mean {i}that{/i} much! We're not married, after all, right?\""
    "\"T...there is that,\" he agreed. Their combined parents had agreed to wait until they were finished with high school, at least, which gave them slightly less than two years. But then.... \"Y...you don't really mind?\""
    "Tsuruya's blush deepened, and she shook her head, not meeting his eyes, but leaning closer to him. \"Kyon-kun is dependable ... and has saved me many times,\" she explained. \"My father spends money like waters, but he's not blind or a fool. H...he can tell how I feels about you, and thinks you'll always be reliable.... And, um, women in my position often finds it difficult to get truly good husbands. So often someone who wants to usurp powers shows up and....\" She gave him a nervous smile. \"Well, I know I can trusts Kyon-kun more than that.\""
    "\"I'd like to be reliable for you,\" he agreed, more than a little awestruck by the fact that Tsuruya actually thought so highly of him. Then again, he supposed it wasn't that often that she would be able to meet someone with the advantages that let him retain his original perspective, yet still be equipped to assist her in the ordeals they'd endured so far. \"Um.... Even though I'm worried about Haruhi's reaction, please don't think it means I think less of you. I'm, er, flattered that you think so highly of me. It's quite amazing to me to end up in such a situation with an extremely likeable and amazing person like yourself.\""
    "Impossibly, Tsuruya's smile brightened. \"You're cute,\" Tsusuya said suddenly. \"But.... Well, I'll find some way to explains this to Haru-nyan.\""
    "He nodded, feeling his face redden at Tsuruya's remark, and sensing the yawning chasm that led to his special hell looming ahead of him. It was really bad letting Mikuru's older self kiss him, while also making out with Yuki, and kissing Haruhi the same day. Now he was {i}engaged{/i} to Tsuruya, which easily trumped them bathing or sleeping together...."
    "And the real hell of it was, as much of a jerk as he thought it made him, he couldn't deny that he cared about all of them. Admittedly, he cared about {i}all{/i} of his friends, but there were moments that he knew went beyond that, on occasion. Kissing, for example."
    "Maybe he should try and spend some time with Kanae, and avoid all of the unintended romance that seemed to be cropping up."
    "\"Speaking of Haruhi, since we skipped the club meeting yesterday, she's almost certainly going to be waiting for me at the train station,\" he said. \"She's going to be upset enough ... probably best not to exacerbate things by going straight to school while she's waiting for me.\""
    "\"Okies,\" Tsuruya agreed. \"Just, don't say anything about the engagements, please?\""
    "\"Alright,\" he allowed, frowning. \"But ... well, as nicely as I can say this, I {i}am{/i} supposed to be responsible for helping protect you. Even though this probably sounds really egotistical, if she gets mad ... I'd rather she lashed out at me instead of you.\" After all, he had armor and force fields; he'd survive probably almost twice as long."
    "She flashed him a smile, breaking away long enough to notify the driver (not Kasai, to his surprise) of the change in destination. After turning her attention back to him, she shook her head and said, \"I'll be okay, Kyon-kun. After all, we looks out for each other, don't we? You keeps the hordes of enemies off my back, and I do what I can to help you!\""
    "Well, he had thought the research she had done for him was actually impressive enough help. Even if the family name had changed somewhat, the idea that he was a descendant of a legendary figure like Usui Sadamitsu.... \"You might be able to distract Haruhi with what you found out,\" he suggested, giving Tsuruya a weak, uncertain smile."
    "She playfully smacked his shoulder. \"Kyon-kun should have more faith in me!\" she protested. \"Aren't Haru-nyan and I friends?\""
    "\"That's true,\" he admitted. He couldn't quite help but feel apprehensive about things, though. He was still trying to come to grips with the whole engagement concept, wondering if it were going to even last, or if it was only temporary until something was worked out. \"Well, in that case, I trust you, but at least promise me that if you need it, you'll ask me for help. I don't think I could forgive myself if you got hurt.\""
    "He wasn't sure he would be able to forgive himself if Haruhi got hurt, either. Maybe he was already {i}in{/i} that special hell?"
    "\"Of course!\" she chirped. \"Just promises me that you won't tell Haru-nyan yourself, in return.\""
    "\"I already said I wouldn't,\" he noted, shaking his head. \"But, if it makes you feel better, I promise.\""
    "She touched one fingertip to her lips thoughtfully, blushing. \"Um.... Though, since we {i}are{/i} engaged, at least for now, there is one other thing....?\""
    "\"What can I help you with?\" he asked, trying to smile once more."
    "\"You know, an engaged woman can get away with this kind of thing,\" she said quietly, an eager glint in her eyes. \"So.... Well.\" She looked about ready to try and say something else, then shook her head and abruptly darted forward, pressing her lips against his."
    "Martial skill was absolutely useless in the face of girls who wanted to kiss him, he realized belatedly, unintentionally responding to Tsuruya's enthusiastic kiss. Though, she was in no way unpleasant to kiss at all.... One of his hands — entirely of its own accord — found its way to the back of her head, running through her hair and pulling her close."
    "Oh, hell, he told himself, if he were going to die, he might as well die a bit happier. And she made a good point — they {i}were{/i} engaged. He knew that kissing well could leave someone stunned — just look at how Mikuru left him! He'd managed to daze Haruhi once, too, so he put his all into making {i}this{/i} kiss potent for Tsuruya. Several minutes passed before they broke for air."
    "Her blush was back, and darker, but her grin was wider than ever. Her eyes seemed dreamy, unfocused, and like him, she was breathing heavily. When she finally collected herself, she gave him a cheery giggle. \"With that,\" she said, not meeting his eyes, \"I have the confidence to go forward. After all, even if you don't say it, you're not fighting being with me....\""
    "\"If I wasn't afraid of the fallout, I wouldn't have a problem with this,\" he acknowledged. Well, his parents trying to make the choice for him {i}was{/i} incredibly annoying, but they could have chosen someone he didn't care for at all. \"Like I said, Tsuruya-kun.... I can understand that you have to be selective, given your position, but {i}any{/i} guy would be fortunate to end up with you. Whatever does happen, um.... I do always want to try and be there for you. Your enthusiasm....\" He trailed off, shrugging with an apologetic smile at her."
    "She grinned back at him. \"You flatterer,\" she teased. \"You mean if Haru-nyan weren't here, you would be happy with this?\""
    "\"No complaints,\" he admitted, wincing. \"Except that saying that sounds disrespectful to you ... and Haruhi, too, really.\" He sighed and shook his head. \"It's probably too much of an unreasonable request ... but I really wouldn't mind if we could all just stay as good friends as we are.\""
    "\"Hehe, you're cute,\" she said again, as the limousine stopped in front of the train station. \"Ah, I see Haru-nyan — let's go say hello~!\""
    "\"Yeah,\" he agreed. At least he'd gotten to share a kiss with Tsuruya before his demise. Really, all things considered, the number of kisses he'd gotten...."
    "That was a more than adequate send-off. Like his legendary samurai ancestor, he should embrace his death with nobility."
    "* * *"
    "After waiting impatiently with Kanae for Kyon to arrive at the train station, Haruhi was surprised to find he and Tsuruya approaching from the station's parking lot ... though, seeing the limousine driving away helped explain that somewhat. She wondered what had happened in their meeting the night before; Kyon looked gloomily resigned, and Tsuruya seemed uncharacteristically nervous, for some reason."
    "Kyon and Kanae walked slightly ahead, while Tsuruya pulled Haruhi behind and whispered that they urgently needed to discuss something during lunch, but wouldn't say more about it."
    "That made class more of a trial than usual, until the lunch chime sounded, and she dashed out of the classroom, pausing only long enough to toss Kyon the extra bento she had made for him. She reached the clubroom first, partly because of a burning need to know what Tsuruya wanted to talk about, and partly because the second year classrooms were just closer to the clubroom. Other than Yuki entering silently, taking her usual seat and reading — the next volume of the Ghost in the Shell manga, though, so that was a bit new — she was left to her own devices, waiting for Tsuruya."
    "With time and energy to spare, she turned on the computer, surfing the internet and checking news stories to follow up on Kyon's shooting. Kyon himself had avoided interviews with reporters, and so had she and the rest of the SOS Brigade. Koizumi and Tsuruya had taken care of that with their connections — which she was grateful for."
    "She raised an eyebrow seeing that there actually {i}was{/i} a new article linked to Kyon's shooting, posted that morning. She browsed over to it, frowning at the headline of, \"Yakuza Syndicate Crushed in Police Raid: High Honors Given to Tamaru Brothers\". She knew them ... and now she knew they were Organization members. But they were real police officers, too?"
    "The article had a picture of Tamaru Keiichi escorting a man in bright suit with a dour grimace to a police car. The caption read, \"Officer Tamaru Keiichi (right) arrests ranking Sumiyoshi-rengo member Fujiya Masao (center)\". Most of the rest of the article went on to explain that the raid was prompted by an investigation to the supplier of firearms in a recent shooting involving an area high-school student as a target. After that was a little bit about the chief arresting officers politely declining requests for interviews."
    "She had just finished reading the article when Tsuruya opened the door, waving with a strangely guilty smile before she closed it behind her. \"Heya, Haru- nyan~!\" she greeted. \"So.... About the meetings with Kyon-kun's family last night?\""
    "\"Is it this bit here, about arresting the yakuza who provided the guns?\" Haruhi asked, pointing at the screen."
    "Tsuruya blinked in surprise and shook her head quickly, moving to Haruhi's side to study the article. \"Oh,\" she said, scanning across it and grimacing. \"Um. That's.... Nothing to do with us. Kyon-kun agreed to bury the hatchets with them.... Hum, the rest of the Sumiyoshi-rengo might blames us for this. We'll keeps our eyes open for that, then.\""
    "Haruhi felt a pang of annoyance.... Well, she consoled herself, she managed to find something out that Tsuruya hadn't known yet, at least. \"Then, what's this all about?\" she asked, turning her attention to Tsuruya."
    "The green haired girl produced an SD card and set it on the desk by the mouse pad. \"I brought some pictures,\" she said, smiling weakly. \"Ah ... but.... So, last night, my father sprung a surprise on Kyon-kun and me.... Um, so, we went to dinner with our parents, and, um, it was ... my father's idea of an omiai....\""
    "Haruhi blinked slowly, feeling the world around her spin, lurching a wildly for a moment. Despite all the motion, until it seemed to suddenly snap back into place, Tsuruya remained staring at her worriedly, unaffected by the strange gravitational shifts, except that her smile faded. Behind Tsuruya, Yuki had raised her gaze from her manga and was watching the heiress with an unblinking gaze."
    "\"S...sorry,\" Haruhi stuttered, one hand going to the back of her head, for reasons she didn't have time to think of gathering her hair up as though to try making a pony tail again. \"Did....\" She closed her eyes and took several deep breaths, dropping her hands to her sides. Why was her heart pounding so hard? \"T...then, what.... What did ... Kyon's mother say?\""
    "Tsuruya looked uncomfortable. \"Um ... she ... doesn't seem to know what our family does? So, she approved, and.... Um.... Well! There's plenty of time! They agreed nothing before college — so, there's plenty of time to talk them ... out of it....\""
    "Even though she felt something like a surge of reassurance at that, she berated herself internally. More of that jealousy.... And she wasn't so blind as to miss Tsuruya's wince at the idea of breaking things off with Kyon like that. \"This is just a bit sudden,\" Haruhi managed. \"A...and....\" She hesitated, then berated herself again. Tsuruya wasn't her enemy — or, really, even a {i}rival{/i}, if they played their cards right. \"Wait. Why should you talk them out of it?\""
    "The heiress gave her a strange look. \"A...are you.... Well, you must be, nyoro. You did promise, after all. You know, I don't plan to try and keep him for myself, Haru-nyan.... Not now.\""
    "\"I guess I'll have to hold you to that,\" Haruhi said weakly, even as Tsuruya's words helped bolster her confidence. Even after everything she had talked about with Kyon's aunt, and remembering Rika's admission that she wished Keiichi had married Mion...."
    "The woman's words had been motivated by guilt, though — she'd said as much herself. Was Haruhi {i}really{/i} being honest that she was trying to arrange for everyone to be happy, if she had to be the star in Kyon's life? One part of a constellation, perhaps, but the brightest point.... Why was it so hard not to be selfish? She'd been as much as {i}told{/i} how badly jealousy could make this entire thing go wrong.... And yet, it was still so difficult."
    "\"You know,\" she said, before Tsuruya could speak, \"i...in a way, this is actually kind of a blessing?\""
    "\"You're sure?\" Tsuruya asked anxiously. \"I don't want you hurt over this, Haru-nyan....\""
    "\"It stings a bit,\" she acknowledged. \"But never mind that. It wasn't your plan. The point is that if you look at it, this way, who Kyon marries is out of his hands. It's not like he tried to propose to just one person, or one of us tried to wring it out of him.... R...really, isn't this a little better?\""
    "Tsuruya raised her eyebrows, then nodded. \"When you say it like that, maybe,\" she allowed, smiling cautiously. \"I still feel a little bad, though.\""
    "\"That's okay,\" Haruhi said, forcing a smile. \"I mean.... I shouldn't be totally selfish, but I'm a little glad.... I think I might really be hurt if this turned out other ways.\""
    "\"My plan is not to take Kyon-kun away from you,\" Tsuruya said insistently. \"Think about it! Without Haru-nyan, I would never have met him!\""
    "\"I can tell you're genuine, you lost your verbal tic again. Well, this set me straight on one regard,\" Haruhi admitted, absently shutting the computer down and rising to her feet. Her knees were still wobbly, so she steadied herself on the desk. \"It's really not fair to leave Mikuru-chan in the dark.... No wonder she's got no confidence about this ... but I've not been very helpful for her.\""
    "Tsuruya nodded, smiling guiltily. \"I didn't want to tell you that,\" she acknowledged. \"So, I'm glad you feel that way now! But ... when do we tell her? And Kyon-kun?\""
    "Haruhi bit her lip. \"If it's not fair to Mikuru-chan, it's probably not fair to Kyon, either,\" she sighed. \"But, even saying that, I want to put that off a bit longer.... Though, if that's the case....\""
    "\"It's not much of a problem for me,\" Tsuruya said quietly, looking out the window as her cheeks colored. \"If we're engaged, um, Kyon-kun and I.... But for everyone else, that's not so fair.\""
    "\"I ... um, get the idea that Kyon won't struggle too much if a girl is a bit forward,\" Haruhi said. \"I mean, he's enough of.... Er, he's....\" She took another deep breath with closed eyes, and mentally slapped her inner tsundere into submission. When she opened her eyes, Tsuruya was looking at her curiously. \"Being honest, Kyon isn't that much of a pervert, so I don't think he'd try to take things, um, too far. S...so, within reasonable boundaries....\" She trailed off with a shrug."
    "\"Would kissing be within those boundaries?\" Tsuruya asked, grinning, sounding the slightest bit guilty. Behind her, Yuki inclined her head the slightest distance, shifting the focus of her gaze to Haruhi."
    "Haruhi found herself laughing before Tsuruya, for once. \"I already did,\" she made herself admit. \"So I'd be a hypocrite if I said no.\""
    "Tsuruya gasped quietly, eyes sparkling. \"So he practiced with you!\" she deduced. \"That's why he was so good.... Er.... Um....\" She quickly looked around, spotting Haruhi's camera in the corner. \"Um, I have a picture of me in a junihitoe on that SD card!\""
    "\"You and him!?\" Haruhi yelled, wincing when she finished at her lack of self- control. At a more reasonable volume, her eyes shifting away from Tsuruya, she managed, \"Er.... I mean.... Yeah, he's really {i}really{/i} good, isn't he?\""
    "\"I thinks so,\" Tsuruya bashfully agreed."
    "Softly closing her manga and setting it down, Yuki added, \"I also think so.\""
    "Haruhi and Tsuruya shared a wide-eyed gasp of realization, turning to stare at the quiet girl. \"Kyon got so good at kissing because of {i}you{/i}!\" Haruhi yelped, pointing an accusing finger at the club's resident bookworm and silent character."
    "\"That is probable. However, I have no comparable metric for comparison,\" Yuki returned blandly, her cheeks shading the merest, tiniest bit red. \"But I do find the sensation ... very enjoyable.\" She blinked, considering things, then asked, \"Did this exceed established permissions?\""
    "\"A...as it turns out, no,\" Haruhi mumbled. \"Though, I feel a bit jealous, now.... Well, I {i}did{/i} say you could 'borrow' him a long while ago.... Though, as Auntie Rika said, that wasn't the best way to go about it.\""
    "Yuki blinked. \"I am uncertain how to address this,\" she said softly. \"Is it appropriate to offer ... practice in this activity as ... apology?\""
    "Did Yuki just offer to teach Haruhi how to kiss better? Why did she have to look so {i}cute{/i} making that offer? \"H...how do you mean?\" Haruhi asked hesitantly. Could she just ... instill skill in her?"
    "\"Y...you means, to practice kissing {i}you{/i}?\" Tsuruya asked, one hand going to her mouth."
    "Yuki nodded solemnly."
    "\"Y...you don't have to offer that!\" Haruhi stuttered, waving her hands before her as though to ward the suggestion off. \"U...um, I appreciate it, but.... Ah....\" Why were those images going through her head?!"
    "\"Y...yeah,\" Tsuruya agreed, chuckling nervously. \"Um ... I don't think we're that good of friends yet, Nagato-chi.... Maybe I could imagine with Haru-nyan, or Mikuru-chan, but....\""
    "\"Gah!\" Haruhi yelped, spinning to stare at Tsuruya. \"Don't tease!\" she protested. That little jealous spark was flaring at the idea that maybe she wouldn't mind so much if Kyon had his way with— If she could just— If he wasn't the only one who—"
    "With no real warning, Tsuruya grabbed Haruhi in a tight hug. \"I'm glad we're friends, then,\" Tsuruya said cheerfully. \"Thanks for being so understanding, Haru-nyan.\""
    "Reassured, her thoughts finally settling down, Haruhi hugged Tsuruya back. \"Fair's fair,\" she grumbled, her face red."
    "\"Plus, you're cute when you're flustered!\""
    "\"Y...you too,\" Haruhi returned, as Tsuruya released her. \"But I almost never get to see a flustered Tsuruya-san!\""
    "\"Haha.... Formal training!\" Tsuruya chuckled, shaking her head, which caused her long hair to sway behind her. \"Say, Haru-nyan, you didn't always used to be so polite — you don't have to call me 'san',\" the heiress remarked. \"After all, like you says, we're friends!\""
    "\"Thanks, Tsu-chan,\" Haruhi allowed, ducking her head. \"Ah ... as much as I'd like to try and make things up to Mikuru-chan by explaining this situation to her, I think I'm near my limit for today. And, anyway, Kyon's engaged to you, now.\" Strange that it was easier to say, though still a little unnerving. She wanted to find Kyon, drag him to the empty stairwell, and be left stunned by his kiss for reassurance as it was. \"S...so, can I trust explaining the situation to you? I want Mikuru-chan and Yuki-chan to have a good time tonight.\""
    "\"You gots it!\" Tsuruya agreed, saluting. \"I will use my engagement powers for the greater good! Should I talks to Kyon-kun, too?\""
    "\"I'm a bit worried about his ego if he understands what's going on completely,\" Haruhi mumbled, crossing her arms over her chest. \"But if we {i}don't{/i} tell him, then we're pressuring him to behave badly and stray, and that's not really for the best, either.\""
    "\"I can tells him that it's okay to be close friends, and maybe a little more?\" Tsuruya suggested. \"After all, we're not {i}married{/i}, just engaged.\""
    "Which was for the best. Aside from her burning desire to drag Kyon off somewhere and make out with him until he couldn't see straight (or she couldn't — whichever came first), she couldn't deal with more at the moment. \"Thanks, Tsu-chan,\" Haruhi managed, smiling shakily. \"I'll have to trust that part to you, then. Any more excitement today, and I think I'll need to lie down!\""
